# Progress tracker: editing the cork board in place

Read this file FIRST in any new session. `PLAN.md` holds the approved plan this
checklist executes. `HANDOFF.md` and `AGENT-HANDOFF.md` hold the traps. Nothing
here supersedes them.

**Repository:** `/Users/cadenwhitt/Claude Code Projects/Experimentation/Final Project/whittworks-CorkboardTesting-site`
**Working branch:** `board-edits`, cut from `corkboard-realism` at `2540468`
**Last updated:** 2026-08-18

## Resume in one paragraph

The owner scrapped the click-to-zoom rewrite on 2026-08-18 and asked for his changes
to be made to the EXISTING site instead. That site works today: a scroll-driven cork
board with eight tuned camera stops, a tan editorial fallback, and a reading mode.
Nothing is being rebuilt. Ten small edits are being made to it, each committed on its
own. Scrolling stays; clicking is added on top. Nothing is pushed until the owner
says so.

## Model routing (owner's standing instruction)

Opus 5 plans, reviews, and approves. Sonnet 5 subagents write the code. Escalate one
sector to Opus 5 only after Sonnet 5 fails repeatedly on that same sector, never the
whole job.

## Phase checklist

- [x] **Phase 1: Remove the bottom chrome and the motion override**
      DONE 2026-08-18. `.board-chrome`, `.scroll-hint`, `.motion-toggle`, `.motion-dot`,
      the `motion-on`/`motion-off` classes, the `ww-motion` sessionStorage override, and
      the hint's fade logic are all gone from `index.html`, `css/style.css`,
      `css/reading.css`, and `js/board.js`. 228 lines deleted, 37 added. The
      reduced-motion media query now applies to `*` unconditionally; `osReduced()` and
      the live `matchMedia` listener survive, so the OS setting is read live and remains
      the only authority.
      Verified: the nine removed identifiers return zero grep hits; `js/board.js` passes
      a syntax check; screenshots at stops 0, 2, 4, and 6 show nothing fixed at the
      bottom; `cdp.mjs stops` output is byte-identical to a pre-edit worktree at
      `be7e9d9`, so the 14/15 and 7/8 sampling numbers are pre-existing and not a
      regression; tripwires moved 1505 -> 1455 on the board and nowhere else, which is
      exactly the 50 characters of deleted chrome text.
      **Byte baseline for Phase 9: 1,842,182 bytes across 47 referenced files**,
      measured by summing `index.html`, `404.html`, every file in `css/` and `js/`, and
      every local asset they reference. Re-run the same method in Phase 9.
      One extra fix beyond the brief: `onMotionChange` still read the deleted `override`
      variable, which would have thrown a `ReferenceError` the moment a visitor changed
      the OS setting mid-visit. Neither the syntax check nor the harness would have
      caught it, because neither fires a live `matchMedia` change.

- [ ] **Phase 2: Copy pass and the Portfolio rename, in both designs**  <- NEXT
      Four "Work" labels, the pink sticky becomes a mailto link, four service stickies
      capitalized, one missing comma, one polaroid caption. Re-measure all four
      tripwires.
- [ ] **Phase 3: The title strip and the kebab dropdown**
      Centered title with the notecard's tagline as a kicker, kebab top right, six
      dropdown entries: About, Services, Portfolio, Reviews, Contact, Whole Board.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Clickable zones**
      Delegated click handler on `#board`, reusing the deskbar's `window.scrollTo`
      path. Links inside zones must win over the zone click.
- [ ] **Phase 5: The circular sticker replaces the center notecard**
      White ring, black disc, interim `W`. Pin 0 stays at (1783, 815) so no string
      moves. Retune stop 1.
- [ ] **Phase 6: The stapled navy trim**
      Four narrow strips in board coordinates at the cork's inner edge. Dark navy near
      `#1b2739`, roughly 60-70 board pixels wide, wavy on the inner edge only, small
      staples around 22 board pixels. Background trim, not a focal point. Papers stack
      above the strips.
- [ ] **Phase 7: The form sheet**
      Relocate two doodle stickies, place the form in the freed cork above the contact
      postcard, retune stop 6, write `privacy.html`.
- [ ] **Phase 8: Wire Formspree**
      `https://formspree.io/f/xyegnvzd` in a new `js/form.js`. One test submission.
- [ ] **Phase 9: Efficiency and review pass**
      Byte count against the Phase 1 baseline, judges per stop, keyboard walkthrough.
- [ ] **Phase 10: Deploy to staging, on the owner's say-so only**

## Waiting on the owner

- The real logo art. The sticker ships the interim `W` from `assets/favicon.svg`
  until it arrives.
- Permission to push. Nothing leaves this machine until he asks.

## Never do these

- Never use, merge, or push branch `board-rebuild`. It holds the scrapped rewrite,
  parked unfinished at `8a8167a`, and the owner rejected that direction.
- Never merge or rebase into `main`. It is an unrelated staging history that gets
  rebuilt from the working branch, never merged.
- Never touch the `whittworks-site` repo. That is live production at
  whittworkstudios.com.
- Never restore Annie Meissner's testimonial. Her cork stays bare until the owner
  raises it and confirms.
- Never fill the reserved cork: x 1240-2340 y 1990-2370 (parked testimonial), and
  x 2400-3540 y 1900-2370 (future product cards).
- Never screenshot through the in-app browser pane. It returns black images when
  hidden. Use `tools/verify/cdp.mjs`.
- The motion override is gone by the owner's decision (2026-08-18). Do not
  reintroduce it. The OS `prefers-reduced-motion` setting is the only authority.

## Verification commands

```bash
node tools/verify/cdp.mjs stops     # eight camera stops, both motion modes
node tools/verify/cdp.mjs modes     # the six render modes and the tripwires
node tools/verify/cdp.mjs shot 0    # screenshot at a stop -> tools/verify/out/
```

## Session log

- 2026-08-17: click-to-zoom rewrite planned and started on `board-rebuild`.
- 2026-08-18: owner scrapped the rewrite. Rewrite parked at `8a8167a`, never pushed.
  Local `corkboard-realism` was 12 commits stale and was fast-forwarded to `2540468`;
  that stale branch is why an earlier session wrongly concluded the two bottom pills
  came from a browser extension. They are real elements at `index.html:551-556`.
  Branch `board-edits` cut, new plan written, Phase 1 not started.
- 2026-08-18: owner decided the motion escape hatch can go entirely, and specified the
  frame: dark navy, wavy, narrow, very small staples, background trim rather than a
  focal point. Plan updated.
- 2026-08-18: Phase 1 complete. Bottom chrome and motion override deleted, verified
  against a pre-edit worktree, tripwires re-baselined in HANDOFF.md. Not pushed.
